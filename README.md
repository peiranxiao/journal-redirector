# journal-redirector
Redirect journal websites to the proxy server of your institution in Chrome. E.g., https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15510 â†’ https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.bu.edu/doi/10.3982/ECTA15510.

When you Google or click on a link to a paper (e.g., http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/mic.3.2.114), more often than not, you are unable to download it directly even though your institution has a subscription (worse still, Institutional Login/Access through your Institution option often won't work). This method saves you the hassle of searching it again on your institution's library or proxy server.

Here is how to configure:
- Step 1: Download the Redirector extension from the Chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd (Add to Chrome).
- Step 2: Download ``Redirector.json`` from this repo.
- Step 3: Replace all "ezproxy.bu.edu" with the prefix of your institution, e.g., "libproxy.berkeley.edu," which can be found by browsing the journal website from your institution's library.
- Step 4: Import this JSON file to the Redirector extension by clicking on its icon (located at the top-right corner) and then choosing "Edit Redirect" and "Import."

Finally, Try clicking on the links given below to see if they are redirected properly:
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15510, http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/mic.3.2.114, https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/710560, https://www.nber.org/papers/w28583.

Currently, it can redirect papers on all AEA journals, Academic OUP (RES, QJE, JEEA), Wiley (ECTA, RAND), JPE, and NBER. Elsevier Journals (e.g., JET, GEB) are not included because the "Access through your institution" option works well.
